## Redirect Switch - A simple extension that redirect requests

Project created by [Matheus Alves](https://github.com/matheus-alpe) (Dev), [Rafael Paludo](https://github.com/RafaPaludo) (Dev) and [Aline Rocha](https://github.com/nesouro) (Product Design) from a necessity encountered in their day to day work: lack of good and easy to use redirect extensions for chrome.
